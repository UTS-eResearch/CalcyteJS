ASF Cave Survey Grades
----------------------

The "ASF Cave Survey and Map Standards" can be found here:
http://www.caves.org.au/resources/internal-resources/category/29-surveying

That document fully describes the survey and map detail grades.
See the section "9. Survey and Map Detail Grades" and "9.1 Survey Grades".

The files in here implement these grades for the Survex cave survey software.
